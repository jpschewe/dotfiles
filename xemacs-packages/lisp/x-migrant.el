;;; Commentary:

;; This package advises the Emacs process startup functions, so that
;; they set up the DISPLAY environment variable correctly.  This is
;; very useful if you run the same Emacs session on multiple X
;; displays at once, and sometimes need to pop up an X application
;; from within Emacs.
