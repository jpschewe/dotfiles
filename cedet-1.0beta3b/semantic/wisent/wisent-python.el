;; Some of these need to come before `wisent-python-default-setup' so that
;; symbols are defined before their first use.

;; Indentation stack to keep track of INDENT tokens generated without
;; matching DEDENT tokens. Generation of each INDENT token results in
;; a new integer being added to the beginning of this list where the
;; integer represents the indentation of the current line. Each time a
;; DEDENT token is generated, the latest entry is popped off
;; this list.

;; Python strings are delimited by either single quotes or double
;; quotes, e.g., "I'm a string" and 'I too am s string'.
;; In addition a string can have either a 'r' and/or 'u' prefix.
;; The 'r' prefix means raw, i.e., normal backslash substitutions are
;; to be suppressed.  For example, r"01\n34" is a string with six
;; characters 0, 1, \, n, 3 and 4.  The 'u' prefix means the following
;; string is a unicode.
